First, use the 'testing_tweets_extractor' file to extract small amount of tweets for each hashtag (will be used as pretended hashtag) in the hashtags list

## Version 1:

1. Use the 'tag_sentiment_prediction_v1_evaluation' file to obtain the ground truth and prediction results for version 1 which will be used in the 'Prediction_Consistency_Evaluation_V1' file

2. Use the 'Prediction_Consistency_Evaluation_V1' file to calculate the consistency in percentage and make the visualization for version 1

## Version 2:

1. Use the 'tag_sentiment_prediction_v2_evaluation' file to obtain the ground truth and prediction results for version 2 which will be used in the 'Prediction_Consistency_Evaluation_V2' file
